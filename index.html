                <p> I am a self taught web developer who's primary focuses are studying HTML and CSS.
                    In order to bring you the visiter the best visual website i can. I have been learning HTML
                    from the specifications on w3.org. W3.org is the site in which all html and css standards are 
                    given to the coding community. So when i make your site i am bringing you the absolute current
                    standards of HTML and CSS. By doing this your site will be up to date and your sites code will
                    very clean and very easy to follow for anyone who has to manage it in the future, and by anyone 
                    up to date with the current specifications them selves.

            <img src="img/javascript.png" alt="JavaScript shield icon" class="JS-icon">
                <p> I am currently in the process of learning Javascript. It is still a new language to me but i
                    am devoting alot of time and energy to understanding it and applying it to not only this site.
                    But to any sites i have the luxury of developing in the future of my career. Once i have finished 
                    learning the basics of the Javascript language i will be updating this page with the latest standards 
                    put out by w3.org as well.
